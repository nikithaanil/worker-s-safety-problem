This project aims at ensuring the safety of workers engaged in heavy lifting works to determine if the load they handle is perilous or not thereby ensuring their safety. 

In order to obtain the signals being generated from the body as a result of lifting heavy loads, the concept of the non-invasive technique is used, and the project undergoes the following steps:

1) EMG signals being produced are obtained using Myoband.
2) Signals obtained are filtered and freed from the noise and useful data are obtained using Signal Processing method.
3) Finally, the data is being categorised into different classes and when a new signal comes, it is able to categorise it accordingly.
